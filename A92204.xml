         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any writings have been of late, in theſe diſtempered times, printed &amp; publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which have proceeded, from the ſeveral authors deſires, to have all men to agree unto them, which have, like as ſtreams of water, run to and fro theſe Nations: Had they come from the pure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there would not have been ſuch difference; but iſſuing from the dirty, miry, and dreggy puddles of art, wit, &amp; humane invention, together with corrupt learning, and imagination, wherein hath been ſeen much Pride, Paſſion, Avarice, Ambition, Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſelf conceit, it cannot be otherwiſe, but that inſtead of being medicinall, as the pure word is, thoſe writings have proved to be killing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive. True it is, where prevaricate and prejudiciall complaints are made, out of the carnall and ſiniſter ends of vain men, there can be no remedy, or relief to their ſatisfaction: But where complaints are, from juſt diſcoveries of God, there is a power goes along, to remedy that that is is complained of: Some would have the whole Orbe guided after one manner, ſome after an other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, each man ſeeking chiefly his own honour, intereſt and profit, and what is corruptly ſeen by them to be good, that they deſire to be done; and conclude all to be evil that ſeemeth againſt their Tenents. Whence it comes to paſſe, that they revile, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute that truth; and that good thing, they ſee not, which others purely ſee, and do declare: dealing with many as <hi>Balaam</hi> did with his Aſſe, beating him
<pb facs="tcp:118099:3"/>
becauſe he ſtopt, and would not carry him along the way where he was going, contrary to the Word of God; the Aſſe ſaw an Angel, with his ſword drawn, but <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw not the Angel. It is even ſo, that many who are accounted Aſſes, &amp; Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots ſee, (the Lord makes them ſee and complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt) that, that many wiſe, and learned men of the world do not ſee; for the wiſdom of the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee nor know God: they ſee no <hi>Babylon,</hi> but what is againſt their jugdement: no <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but that of <hi>Rome:</hi> no <hi>Whore,</hi> but what keeps not correſpondency with the viſible <hi>Church:</hi> no <hi>Beaſt</hi> but onely the poor, profane, and breaker of the Civill Law. They ſee not the impure purity, the diſſembled Chriſtianity, the unſavory Salt, the covnterfet Diamond, the droſſy ſilver: But think that the late bruſtring of their own Garments, to be the Garment of Chriſt, the new guilding of their baſe mettle, to be very gold; that they are ſufficiently changed, becauſe Baptized, and Civilized; that they know the Lord, if they can tell the report that they have heard of him: and know themſelves, if they can ſay, they are ſinners. Here <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in the myſtery, exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf againſt Chriſt, in the myſtery, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth him; laying ſtumbling blocks before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, loving the wages of unrighteouſneſſe, more then the hidden treaſure: The conſideration of this, hath, together with the great fire that is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by providence, ſet more pens to work: for they that bear good will to <hi>Sion,</hi> cannot for its ſake, hold their peace, but muſt declare, the things that they have heard and ſeen, and what will ſhortly be: Even the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the deſtruction of
<pb facs="tcp:118099:3"/>
the great Whore, which hath been ſpoken of by the Prophets, by riddles, and compariſons, ſo twiſted that the Clergy could not undoe: as alſo the new Jeruſalem coming down from God out of heaven, Chriſts finall conqueſt and exaltation, over ſin, death and hell, the Saints ſpiritually and moſt purely refined, purified and ſublimed, from ſinfull and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall forms, and will-worſhip: Were it not, that that impurity lodgeth with purity, and Antichriſt found to be in the ſeat of Chriſt, there would not have been ſuch a fiery contention, but when curing compoſitions are found to be deſtroying potions, if veſſels of truth, and ſimplicity, are changed to lies, and formality, what lamentation may be taken up, that our guides and our counſellours are fallen, in their wiſdom, <hi>Surely the Lord is departed from his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thanks be to God, there is a ſtill, and a ſoft voice, that rendeth the Mountains, ſhakes the Rocks, divideth the waters, and expelleth darkneſſe apace, that true Religion, and Righteouſneſſe, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof, (or rather the ſeeming friends of it) would extinguiſh and bury, now beginneth to get rooting, and to grow from dry Bones, to an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Army.</p>
            <p>Should any one then be ſilent, whom the Lord biddeth to ſpeak, waiting on the Learned, the Aged, and the Honourable men to ſpeak, fearing the revilings of the Diſputer, and Oppoſer: No, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be the leaſt, and the worſt of his Fathers houſe, being thereunto appointed and enabled, he muſt do his duty, knowing that the Lord is riſen and doth great things, by ſmall and contemptible
<pb facs="tcp:118099:4"/>
meanes, and that out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklings, he ordaineth ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Upon this account, was the enſuing matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me, by that Imperiall hand, which ſwaieth all, having no power to wave the medling with this ſubject, that tendeth to the diſcoveries of a pure trim'd Whore, which gloriouſly glittereth, like the Sun, that ſpeaketh ſo much of righteouſneſſe, and integrity, that none, without high preſumption and very great affront, dareth to queſtion, eſpecially without a learned tongue, and a gilded pen.</p>
            <p>What here is ſpoken, is not to flatter any, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it unjuſtly to cenſure, but to adviſe from the Lord, the painted face to briniſh teares &amp; ſad cheeks; the eleoquent and Oratory tongue, to ſilence in the glory of the fleſh; the raking and greedy hand, to Charity, Liberality, and Sobriety, the impotent and lame feet, to walk according to their ſtage, and ſtrength; yea, and the whole man, to his purging, and refining change. Perhaps ſome may ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this fiery Change ſhal be before the final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the whole world (having been taught that it is not till then.) Moſt certain, it is before: Have you heard and ſeen the late inventions, that men have had, in all nations by fire, (preſaging that God may by fire do more ſtrange things): the one of guns, and, that great ſlaughters, ſuddain batteries, ſpeedy victories, and mighty conqueſts, have been made by them, both by Land, and Sea: the other of Tobacco, accounted to be as vitall, to the ſupport of the naturall life of man, ſeeming to overpoiſe bread, in the traffick of it; which inventions our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, never heard of; Hath man found out theſe
<pb facs="tcp:118099:4"/>
fiery wayes, the one for deſtruction, and the other for preſervation? and cannot the great God, finde out wayes by fire, the one to conſume his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Antichriſt, the Whore, and the beaſt; and the other to burne, and conſume the droſſe, out of his Church, that they may be preſerved (being by it made fit Temples) to eternall life? Tophet is ordained for the King; for that, that doth exalt, in the Church, or in any particular minde, againſt God: He will ſlay thoſe, that will not he ſhould reign over them, and he will melt his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they may be rid of all their droſſe, he will conſume their fleſh, that he may be ever with them, in Spirit.</p>
            <p>Reader, the Lord hath manifeſted to me, that there is nothing more, that he will make war againſt, than againſt the impure Saints, the droſſy Silver, the bad coin that hath, <hi>filius Dei,</hi> on the outſide, and droſſe within.</p>
            <p>Would the Church viſible of <hi>England,</hi> did but ſee, how they are cheated? a little light varniſh ſilvering or gilt without is nothing, to the maſſey body of Braſſe, Tinn, Iron, and Lead within, which God will melt and take away: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, and he will redreſſe; his people ſhall not be his, onely in name, but as he is himſelf, <hi>Gold:</hi> and, as Chriſt the Word is <hi>Silver:</hi> What God hath accquainted me with, I am to acquaint, as many as love the Lord Jeſus. Read it in the Spirit.</p>

Almighty God is a pure, a holy, and a good God; there is nothing can remain, or dwell with God, but holineſſe and purity: holineſſe becomes his habitation,<note place="margin">Hag. 2.9.</note> the gold and the ſilver are his, the droſſe and droſſie metals are ours. By gold, is underſtood the gifts and graces of Gods holy Spirit; and by ſilver, the word of truth, the word of God, yea the word, God. There can be no union between gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and droſſe: for droſſe is that imperfect matter which doth accompany metals, and is to be ſevered from them at the firſt riſe of them out of the earth, and taken from the metall, as the ſcum and film of the metall, by a refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and a purging fire. Droſſe likewiſe is found among
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118099:10"/>
metals ſubject to ruſt, and apt to receive into it ſelf cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, being in veſſels; and this likewiſe by melting and refining is cleanſed and made clear. Droſſe of it ſelf is worth nothing, yet it fixeth and abideth in metals, and may be by the skilfull refiner brought to ſomething, being waſhed and purified.</p>
            <p>Is England droſſe? ſee, are they not like the houſe of Iſrael, that were Idolaters, and other kindes of ſinners; what ſin is there that is not committed in England? Hath not God lately, and now at preſent, made triall of us,<note place="margin">Mark 12.1, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </note> as the Husbandman did of thoſe that kept his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; he hath ſent his ſervants to ſee what fruit we have for him, and we yeeld him none at all; but beat, revile, reproach, and perſecute his ſervants. That light that he hath ſent amongſt us, our fathers ſcarce heard of it, but never ſaw it, that diſcovers Antichriſt, the Beaſt, and the Whore: Antichriſt to be man exalted in the fleſh, man &amp; the righteouſneſſe of man, in us; the Beaſt to be the man of ſin, that is, man deceiving himſelf,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.3.</note> thinking to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when he is nothing; for man of himſelf is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without God, but as a beaſt: and the Whore to be, man, that ſeems to live with God in the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, or Church; and lives on the traditions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men, cleaving onely to the wiſdom and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and not deſiring God to be all in all. Do we not hate the meſſengers of truth, and ſin with an high hand againſt the bounty and love of God? falling to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall whoredoms and fornications, like the Concubines and Harlots, having a ſeeming heart for God, but wholly yeelding of it up to the ſervice of the Devil, the world, and the fleſh, hating thoſe that tremble at the word of God, caſting them out for his names ſake, and ſay,<note place="margin">Eſa. 66.5.</note> Let the Lord be glorified; but mark the end, the one ſhall have the appearance of God to their joy, and they the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>What is the demeanour of the people of England in their profeſſion? Is it not meerly outſide? The more mercy and love God doth beſtow on us, the more we lift
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118099:11"/>
up our heels againſt him, when we ſhould live and praiſe him in the admiration of his bounty, beholding our great dignity in and through Chriſt: he hath called us to be his ſons, heirs of a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, and fellow-heirs with Chriſt; in that Kingdom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us unto a union with himſelf, my Tabernacle ſhall be among men,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. ult. Col. 2.19.</note> as he hath ſaid. We are his portion, and he is our portion, we are his fulnes, having the increaſes of God; yet notwithſtanding all this, we are wedded to fleſhly ſervices and forms, and content our ſelves with the bare names of Chriſtians, denying the life and power of Chriſtianity, and do hate thoſe that live in that power.</p>
            <p>Our ſervices and worſhip of God are as dead things, not being done by our ſelves, but by an Attourney; we do not call on God by a dead Saint, but by a living man, who may be as dead, having not the life of God in him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath attained to the firſt reſurrection, a poor ſervice that is not in our own perſons, with our own hearts. Many there are that neither call on God themſelves, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do aſſent to the prayer of another; but cuſtom and faſhion cauſes them to bring their bodies to a publike place, where the poor blinde heart cannot tell what he comes for; neither is he carefull, being benummed, what the iſſues of his ſenceleſſe comming will be. Is this the coming to Chriſt for life? Is this the way to get acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God? No, this is that droſſe, and more there is like to it that doth accompany the good metall; but it ſhall in time be caſt out, and then we ſhall learn of Chriſt, for he is meek, and not learn of thoſe that are proud boaſters, haters of God, inventers of evil things, and deſpiſers of the pure light and truth.</p>
            <p>O that the Lord, would ſhew men the deceitfulneſſe of their own hearts, that can be content, with the husk and ſhell of Religion, &amp; be ful of glorying in that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which they have gotten by outward meanes, in their own wiſdoms and imaginations, and utterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, refuſe, and abhor, the inward binding of their ſouls up in union, by Chriſt with the Father, in the free Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118099:11"/>
of Grace and life. Many will ſay, What, ſhall we we not pray? when they neither know, what God is, nor what themſelves are; ſuch as preſume to pray, without knowledge, do break the command of God, in taking his Name in vaine, when the heart is not according to the tongue, and ſound; yea, when their Company, or their Congregation agreeth not: for there is the hater and the hated, the oppreſſour and the oppreſſed; the rich, that cares not for the poor; and the poor, that curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the rich; What congregall prayer, can there be, in this mixture, when mens hearts, are one aginſt the other? The rich and the poor goes together, but the Lord is the maker of them both; he knows their hearts, &amp; their ends, in comming to publike places: every ſound &amp; noiſe is not a prayer; then the Phariſee had been commended, for his long one; but it is the inward and deep ſighings of the heart, in the ſingleneſſe thereof, and being fervent: We are commanded to pray continually; and they that make long prayers, are condemned, being in oſtentation as in publike congregations, once or twice in a week, and have little converſe with God all the reſt of the week; be not deceived, God is not mocked; Whatſoever ye ſow, that ſhall ye reap:

            <p>Be aſhamed, and ſtand amazed, all ye that are under the great Light, that God hath cauſed to ſhine forth in this Nation. You will ſay, that you are the people of God, and that you know him, but it appears by your actions, that you know him not; for a man to know a thing, is to know the condition of it, as to know a peece of coine. To know God, is another manner of buſineſſe, than the world makes it; to know God, is to have experience of him, and of all his Attributes, his Mercy, his Love, his Goodneſſe, his long ſuffering, &amp;c. To know God in Chriſt, is the true knowledge of him, to be in Union and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118099:12"/>
Communion with him, to obey him, love him, and fear him, to honour him, and glorifie him; this the world knoweth not, for the world ſeeks its own. Therefore many, that do profeſſe, that they know God, and in their works do deny him, are not onely Heathens, but they are worſe then the heathens;<note place="margin">Cato.</note> for they ſay, If there be a God, he ought to be worſhipped, with a pure minde: miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the condition, of many that think it ſufficient to have the bare name of a Chriſtian, and ſay, Chriſt died for me, and roſe again for me, and never felt the power of Chriſts death, killing ſin in them, nor the vertue of his Reſurrrection, quickening, and raiſing them, to a new life, that cannot witneſſe a new birth, a ſeparation; But live in the old nature, and the old man of ſin, remaining ſtill. Deale plainely with your ſelves, ye ſons of men, for the caſe doth require it; do not loſe your precious time here, and ſay, I hope to go to Heaven, whereas you know not, what heaven is, neither are you fit for it: for heaven is a Condition, rather then a Local place, and the heavenly condition, ſtands not in outward things, as to ſatisfie the fleſh, neither is it found, any otherwiſe, then in the Croſſe here in this World, but it doth appear in us, by Peace of conſcience, and joying in the Holy Spirit of God, being perfectly aſſured, and having a firme teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of our Reſurrection; being Adopted, and made the Sons of God,<note place="margin">1 John 1.3.</note> and having fellowſhip with the Father, and the Son.</p>

Take the droſſe from the ſilver, and there will proceed a veſſell fit for the refiner: when the Almighty God, hath purged and purified the ſilver, and ejected and caſt out the droſſe, then there is a veſſell for himſelf, a temple for himſelf, to dwell in; for the Lords delight is in his Saints, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and ſilver is as his Word is, when it is refined. Meddle not, nor have to do with the moſt Holy, and pure God, upon any account, living in your own wiſdome, wills and luſt; for it had been better for <hi>Cain,</hi> that he had offered no Sacrifice, then to account the beſt too good for God, and to offer the worſt; better not to come to any Table, then to the Table of the Devils: the end of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is to bring ſoules to God, not to make a greater ſeparation by it from God. You were once a far off, but now ye are made nigh, by the Blood of Chriſt: that onely brings us neer to God; draw neer through his Blood, and he will draw neer to us, look to your hearts, and to the iſſues of all exerciſes, not what the exerciſe is, but to what it tendeth; for it is either life or death; If you ſerve God in the fleſh; you ſhall have corruption, and death for your reward; if you live to the fleſh, you ſhall die; but if through the Spirit, you mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, you ſhall live. God accepteth no ſacrifice done in the fleſh, but as he is a Spirit moſt holy, ſo he muſt be worſhipped, in Spirit and in Truth, which was the Legacy Chriſt Jeſus left with his Diſciples, when he left them. We cannot come to the Lord with anything of our own, to be acceped of him, but what we come to him with, muſt be his; he heareth nothing but his own Spirit, and that he wil not deny. What ſaith Chriſt, In vain do they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, &amp;c. The Lord (Eſay. 1.) ſaith, What have I to do with your Sacrifices? and in the ſame firſt of <hi>Eſaiah,</hi> I hate your new Moons, and your appointed feaſts, they

            <p>All the devices of men, all their art, all their inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeding onely from them, in drawing neer to to God, is nothing worth, for it cannot but differ from the will of God; in Gods worſhip, the more of mans wiſdom the leſſe of Gods reſpect, the more plainer, and ſimplier we worſhip him, the more hope of acceptance. The ordinances of man, or of any Churches, if they differ in the leaſt from the will of God, muſt be caſt out: For not onely humane reaſon, but divine reaſon, not ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, can may or ought to have any power, in the ordering, placing, or diſpoſing of any worſhip of God: The will of God onely is the reaſon of his own worſhip; and mans reaſon, can be no ground, for ſuch a ſtructure, which his art and ſcience defileth as ſeparate from the will of God.</p>

            <p>Much might be ſaid concerning the droſſe, that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the pure metall: In plain termes; the corruption the filth and the uncleanneſſe, that is among profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing people, that profeſſe to be the people of God, and are civilized exceedingly, that to the eyes of the World are almoſt ſpotleſs, but when God comes to try by fire, then will their filth and droſſe appear.<note place="margin">Prov. 7.3.</note>

Therefore it is, that the exerciſe of Religion, which ſhould cure, and eject our droſſe; by an addition of more filth and impurity, in that which ſhould ſpeak purity and life, it doth kill and brings death.

            <p>It pleaſed God, by theſe compariſons of metals, to diſcover what his people are, and how they are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in purity from himſelf, which is moſt pure and holy: let therefore all men that live in a profeſſion, not ſtand upon the purity of it; for the Whore ſits upon wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; there is many baptiſms of water, but the baptiſme of fire, is that that God will purifie his people withall: and that that hath quenched this many yeers,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> muſt now be dried up by the fire of the Lord, and it will burn up all, and dry up all, For our God is a conſuming fire.

            <p>Thirdly, God ſaith that Iſrael is Braſſe, and Tin, and Iron, and Lead: What Iſrael was and what England is, by theſe compariſons of metals, the Lord will make known to us; Theſe ſeverall metals, are of ſeverall natures, and qualities, ſome by art, counterfeiting the richer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, of Gold, and Silver, which are figures of Himſelf and of his word:</p>
            <p>Theſe metals, are very apt to ruſt, and to receive and embrace the ſame, and ſo are accounted droſſy metals; yet very vſefull, as to the World, ordained by the great

Creatour in their ſeverall kndes, for ſeverall neceſſitous negotiations, in the world. They have their breeding, and their generation in the earth; and being from thence and thereout, they muſt paſſe through a ſtrong blowing fire, before they come to perfection, and be fit to offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the uſe, ſervice, and the end, the great Creatour made them for, as to the uſe of the world: wherein is ſeen, a great deal of the glory of God, in the excellency of his creation, in the various qualities of them, as doth alſo appear in all other things created by God.</p>
            <p>How is Iſrael Braſſe, and Tin, and Iron, and Lead? wherein, and in what are they ſuch metals?</p>
            <p>The people of Iſrael here named, are thus, in divers reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are Braſſe, in their men of power, Rulers, Governours, Magiſtrates, Juſtices, and Arbiters.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are Tin, in their Prophets, Teachers, Guides, and Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are Iron, in the people of Trafficke, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, Trade, and merchandiſe, and in them that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to the ſupport of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They are Lead, in the poor and mean, in people of low degree.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſee what Braſſe is, and how it may be ſaid, that Rulers, Governours, &amp;c. May be as braſſe:</p>
            <p>Braſſe is a compound metall, made and contrived of Copper and Calamy, which metall ſo compoſed, hath a luſtre, like gold by its mixture, and the more uſefull for it's mixture: So are thoſe that are called to high places, of Government; they are not barely naturaliſts, onely men as borne ſimply themſelves naturally; But there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture compoſed with other ingredients in them, of natural endowments fit for their places, of learning, experience, knowledge, underſtanding and rightly to cenſure, as alſo to execute, as to the World, the things, matters, and cauſes that are under their diſpenſation, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; and herein, as braſſe hath a luſtre like gold, ſo have the Governours, &amp;c. a luſtre beyond other men;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118099:14"/>
Hence it is, that there is and hath been, at all times, an honour and a reſpect given unto them, being the greateſt inſtruments under the arme of God, for the peace, the welfare, and the good of people, in the Nations under them.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid, You are Gods, and you are all,<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.6.</note> the children of the moſt High; Chriſtians have had at all times, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their governours, for Gods ſake, they are ſet up of God; By me kings reign, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> There is no power but of God: wherefore reſiſt not the powers; they that doe, ſhall receive to themſelves judgement.</p>
            <p>But whence is the complaint that the Lord makes, that Iſraels Rulers are Braſſe, ſomething is the matter; God Almighty expecteth, that they ſhould not onely doe, and execute the common and ordinary buſineſſe, as to the World, but that they ſhould ſtand up like men, in the cauſe of God, to diſtribute juſtice impartially, and as in his ſtead; to curb; and puniſh the evil doers, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and preſerve thoſe that do well, encouraging others alſo, to live in their wayes; that they ſhould be as nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fathers, and nurſing mothers;<note place="margin">Eſa. 49.23.</note> they ſhould defend the innocent, and acquit him, and execute juſtice on the nocent.</p>
            <p>The cauſe why, the Lord complaineth of them, and that he will melt them is, that, as Braſſe will adulterate with Tin and with lead, with the falſe prophet, and with the rable; So the Rulers and Governours, have not walked ſingly before God, but have mixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with that that hath been againſt his pure, and undefiled law, yeelding to the Harlot, <hi>Iezabell;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 22.6.</note> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king counſell of the multitude of falſe prophets, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> did, embracing flatterers, and flatteries, which hath cauſed them to erre; to do injuſtice, to puniſh the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and not let the oppreſſed go free, and do in their waies, according to their own wills &amp; fleſhly luſts, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to their fleſhly deſires and underſtandings, minding their own profit, pleaſure, &amp; worldly advantages; and as the poor rabble of the world doth for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;

ſo do they, out of their ambitious hearts, for further honour, and preferment not doing the thing that is right.</p>
            <p>Was it thus with Iſrael, and among their men of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and is it not ſo with England? It is nor my buſineſſe to reckon up the wickedneſſe that was heretofore, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer powers that are paſt and gone; But to the preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my duty is to ſtir up all Chriſtians to a hearty thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and to a continuall praiſing of God, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that he hath ſet over us, ſuch a valiant, and God-like <hi>Joſhua;</hi> and for that, through the late paſſages of war, and diſcord, wherein once we were in jeopardy to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled, and our religion to be traduced, we are arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to the greateſt liberty of any people under Heaven, Religion, and godly people being much countenanced, and defended, ſuperſtition and hereſie extirpated in a great meaſure, no mans conſcience compelled, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of Antichriſtian plotters, and contrivers, not onely weakned, but confounded, to their ignomy, and ſhame for ever, ſubordinare Magiſtrates in their pluces, more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and knowing, and the profeſſing people of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much increaſed by it.</p>
            <p>Hath God begun to melt the braſſe, to refine the men of power; Let no man murmure then, at the powers; for the effects, and iſſues of Chriſtian and God-like powers, we and our ſucceſſours, may rejoyce in; for it is of great conſequence, to our eternall, and everlaſting peace; That when pure truth doth begin to appear in our daies, no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent heat of perſecution can wither it, for upon all the glory there will be a defence: if God maketh us his glory, he wil defend us,<note place="margin">Eſa. 4.3.</note> that neither the wilde Bore of the foreſt, nor the little Foxes of the wildernes ſhal hurt us, God wil keep his Vineyard,<note place="margin">Eſa. 54.11, 12.</note> that he himſelf hath planted; He will yet go forward, and be refining ſtill, untill he hath made the Pillars of his Church, like to the poliſhed Saphirs, and her windowes of ſhining Emraulds; He will melt, and purifie all that bear his Name,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 12.</note> and are for the cauſe of his people, that they ſhall be as pure, as his Word which is Silver.

them; He will not lay his Garden waſte, but weed out that that is hurtfull, to the growth of the tender plants; he will not touch thoſe flowres that have favour, but them that have no ſavour, but colour onely.</p>
            <p>Great hope have we, that the Lord will be gratious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, becauſe he hath begun ſo to be; ſurely what God begins, he will finiſh, who can hinder him,<note place="margin">

There is in our nation, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who are as braſſe veſſels, (I would they were veſſels for God) But what are they? I fear that they are, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles them that were in his time, 1 Cor. 6. In the firſt verſe he calls them unjuſt, and in verſ. 6, he calls them Infidels, how ever, they are ſuch that he warnes the Saints not to meddle withall, and queſtions whether there was a wiſe man among them, or no: a ſtrange thing. It ſeemes none but fooles hath to do with them. Thefe men are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in our language Lawyers, ſome ſay they are neceſſary evils, but they are ſuch as hold evill to be neceſſary, and ſurely, if any evil be neceſſary; this is, it is as neceſſary as a diſeaſe which pains ſo ſorely, that makes the patients cry to their God; for many thouſands have bin impoveriſhed by their evill practices, and they ſtill gainers. It is in their hands, to compoſe differences more eaſier: But they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, double dealers, oppreſſours, exactours, and cruell. When matters come to them to view, skan, order, and to prepare for the determiner, what horrible falſe dealing is there? bribery, treachery, forgery, falſe teſtimony, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand and partiall dealing, as if they were made of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to act the Divels part.</p>
            <p>Theſe are like unto the braſſe veſſels that are uſed in and upon the fire; for they are not onely Incendiaries to ſtrife, envy, malice, and contention, but are nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and pleaders for the continuance of it. Did not Chriſt ſay, Bleſſed are the peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the children of God? Whoſe children are they then that ſet at variance, who love not peace? is it againſt their

profit? The veſſels they are like to, are kettles and pans, which as to the buſineſſe of the world are very uſefull; as the kettle holds water, ſo there is fire underneath it that makes it boil, and oftentimes the heat of the fire boils away the water, ſometimes the fierceneſſe of the fire makes the water to boil over, and put out the fire. It is ſo with this generation, that the exerciſe of their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty makes the watery Client, I mean the man that mourns to be in Law, to be the better, as water is by heating, for uſe. But it uſually fals out, that the water overcomes the fire, or the fire dries up the water, and ſo the kettle or pan being waſht, or ſcoured with ſome of <hi>Pilates</hi> water makes it ſhine as it did before,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> after the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of gold, and ſtands up for a ſhew in many Countrey Churches and Congregations, where the Miniſter there dares not ſpeak a word, but ſmooth him up for a good Benefactour, for fear of his place, his tithe, or ſomething he cals his dues, or fearing to have his ill will.</p>

            <p>In the ſecond place let us ſee what Tin is, and how, as before mentioned, Iſraels Prophets, Prieſts, Teachers, and Guides are as tin.</p>
            <p>Tin is firſt like to ſilver, in its luſtre, in its ſound, and in its weight.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it will adulterate with other metals.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it will beautifie and colour other metals, yea, the very earth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is a dry metall, and therefore when it is bended, it will creek.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it will receive any impreſſion; yet not malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, it is a metall that fire will utterly conſume to aſhes.</p>
            <p>The Prophets and Prieſts of old that were reſembled to tin, the Lord much complained of, by <hi>Iſaih, Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and other of his Prophets: ſo that the Lord, when he ſaith by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 1.25.</note> chap. 1. verſ. 25.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118099:17"/>
that he would take away all the tin, it is to be underſtood, that he would take away all the Prophets, Prieſts, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Diſpenſers of his word, that were, as tin is to ſilver: for his Prophets that were called, and ſent by him, they were as ſilver, even as the word; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were but counterfeit, falſe, and abominable, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the inſuing matter, being a very large complaint againſt the picturall imagery, and ſimilicall kinde of Prophets, Prieſts, Teachers, and Diſpenſers of the word, as they call themſelves; as alſo againſt all proud, covetous, boaſters, inventers of evil things, all idle drones, Ignoramuſſes, dunces, doters, illiterate, unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, vain, profane, ambitious, envious, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſons, that have undertaken to teach, inſtruct, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, comfort, pray for, and to viſit, to ſtand in the gap, to mediate, and abſolve, being unacquainted with the myſteries of God, and have not their union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God and Chriſt; Let not thoſe true Prophets, or Teachers, which do declare the minde of the eternall God plainly, who tels <hi>Jacob</hi> of his ſins, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> of his tranſgreſſion; let not them, I ſay, that are ſent of God, and ſpeak not their own teſtimony, which do beleeve,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.</note> &amp; therefore do ſpeak without flattering, or fear of any mans perſon, or any croſſe power miſ-led, be exempted from their moſt inward and inviſible calling, to accompany theſe intruders, uſurpers, and defilers of mankinde.</p>
            <p>Firſt, tin is like to ſilver: it was the Devils policy, when he tempted our firſt parents,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 3.</note> to tell them that they ſhould be as gods, or like God: To be like that we are not, is ſtill in the deſire of the earthy and carnall minde: It is the onely thing profeſſion doth purſue, and rejoyceth in, to be like that another is; to be like ſil er, is to be like the pure word of God; for that the Word the Son of God is reſembled to, they that ſhould teach others, ſhould not be onely the image or the likeneſſe of that they do teach, but they ſhould be the very ſame not like the oracles of God and not them; like the true Prophets, but are falſe prophets; declaring the letter, either
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118099:18"/>
through their own practicall art and ſcience, or elſe by ſtealing that from others, which themſelves had not art to compoſe. This cunning ſophiſtry hath been much in uſe, and it is got into that garb that it deceiveth many, and they deceive themſelves to ſpeak &amp; prate of that that is not within them, but without them; they teach not the teſtimony of Jeſus, that ſhould be the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, but ſpeaks out their lying vanities to deceive, yet taken by the world for teachers of the truth.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 15.16.</note> But <hi>S. Paul</hi> bids other Apoſtles not to teach by another mans line, but to get praiſe of God; for he that ſeeketh his praiſe of men, or from himſelf, is not allowed of God. Such Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are deceitfull workers,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.12, 13, 14, 15.</note> that transform themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt; and no marvell, for Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of life: therefore it is no great thing, though his Miniſters transform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as though they were the Miniſters of righteouſnes, whoſe end ſhall be according to their works.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Tin is like ſilver in colour, in luſtre; ſilver is of a very bright colour, and ſhineth much, and tin doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it in the colour and brightneſſe as much; for we may finde by things made of tin being in ſhape and form of the ſilver veſſels, ſome are apt to take one for the other, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing not in their neer view; ſo the Miniſter he ſhineth, and is a ſpectacle for his whole pariſh to look on, and for others where he reſorteth, obſerving all the rules of civil carriage and behaviour, a fair outſide, good words, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, ſeemingly thankful for courteſies, temperate ſober, and ready to give advice, and every way ſeeming to be of a godlike behaviour, like the painted ſepulchres that are fair on the out-ſide, but within nothing but dead mens bones.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tin is like ſilver in its ſound, ſilver hath a very ſweet ſound to the ear of man, and nothing can paſſe it; ſo the ſound that the Miniſter doth make,<note place="margin">Jer. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.14.</note> is very ſweet to the ear, for they ſound out the great love of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the letter, and tell of his great mercies, like the ſound of the pure word: but where is the true ſound of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118099:18"/>
the word that ſoundeth to us, the taking up the Croſſe, the ſubmitting and yeelding of our wils to Gods will, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying our ſelves, loſing of our lives: this is bitter, <hi>Durus ſermo</hi> to themſelves, and cannot ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> did, that he rejoyced in the Croſſe, that is the ſweeteſt ſound to the ſoul, when the myſtery of God comes to be revealed by the Croſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tin is like ſilver in its weight, herein is ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but yet many times Tin hath not been ſu pected by wait, when a piece of coin hath been counterfeited by it, it is neer it in the weight of it. So are Miniſters like ſilver in the weight, they will ſpeak of as weighty matters and as preſſing, as if the very power of the Lord went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with their voices, when it is nothing but a meer preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the minde for the preſent, and makes the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly man or woman (it may be) ſermon-ſick. Where is the alteration and change of the minde wrought? It cannot, though they preſſe home with loud voices, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words, dreadfull and threatening quotations, all is nothing, it is but as the weight of Tin. But the word it ſelf figured to us by ſilver, is that that ſhews its perfect and abſolute weight, when that without (as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) makes a greater ſhew; for when the Temple was builded, there was no noiſe of axes and hammers,<note place="margin">1 King. 6.7.</note> nor any tool elſe, while it was building, ſo the inward work of the word is not by outward hammering, but by a low and ſtill voice into the inward part.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Tin will adulterate with other metals, and mix it ſelf with them, it will adulterate and mix with braſſe, and ſo it becomes hard, joyning with a hard ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere metall. So doth the Clergy, they mix and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the power and authority, taking that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them they are not called unto by the Lord: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe theſe late times, wherein the Epiſcopacy had great power and authority to do and undo, upholding by their power t e Beaſt and Antichriſt, compelling men to obſerve dayes and meats, and the Orders of their Rubrique, who did puniſh with as ſevere a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118099:19"/>
him that did deny Biſhops to be <hi>Jure divino,</hi> as he that ſhould deny Jeſus Chriſt, or the Father, to be God. Bleſſed be God we are delivered from that horrible adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and ſo far is tin refined, or melted, nay, in that caſe taken clean away: yet the ſeed of that power lies in the earthy minde; for the Clergy would (if poſſible) bear ſome ſway, but becauſe they cannot, they are gotten to be Incendiaries to the Magiſtrate againſt the Innocents, for that the myſtery of Antichriſt is by them a diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and laying open to the Beleever, which they cannot endure to hear of, becauſe they are the chief concerned in upholding him, it is conceived that they are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hinderers of the growth of the pure and infallible truth. But what can they do? their power, if they were ſo many Biſhops, might be reſtrained: their behaviour concerning marriage heretofore did teſtifie what they were,<note place="margin">Pſal. 76.10.</note> and now they rage: but the rage of man will turn to the praiſe of God, and the reſt God will reſtrain. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of his perſecutors, Why perſecute ye me, as God, is not my fleſh ſufficient? let them take heed who they perſecute, for Chriſt is upon the earth, though not ſeen by them, nor heard out of the pulpit, and God is ſhaking the heavens, they are chiefly to look to it for they are as the pillars of that heaven that ſhall fade: It is ſaid, when the Son of man ſhall come, ſhall he finde faith on the earth? It is to be doubted, whether there will be any, or no; for the channell begins to be dried up: the Spirits preſence is not where ſome ſay it is, and therefore ſuſpect your ſelves, you that would mix with the authority, take heed of kindling any more fire, if you do, you are like to be burnt in it.</p>
            <p>Again, Tin will adulterate and mix with lead. This is a ſtrange thing, that tin ſuch a ſhining metall ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe it ſelf ſo to mix: yet ſo it is, the Clergy will mix themſelves with the poor rabble of the world,<note place="margin">Hoſea 7.8.</note> thoſe that are ignorant, and though not openly profane, yet ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vile, making them the executioners of their deſigned purpoſes; what they will not be ſeen to do themſelves,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118099:19"/>
they encourage and countenance the poor to do, as in the perſecution of the tongue, to mock and deride the poor Northern men, that goes about, ſpeaking words of the kingdom, ſuch as <hi>Noah</hi> was to the old world, a Preacher of righteouſnes. In this matter the Miniſters of the land, ſhew no ſpirit of meeknes,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.</note> neither are they Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel that do not obey the Goſpel of our Lord: he ſaith bleſſe them that cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſſe and hypocriſie, which they do diſcover by their converſe with the poor: for what is ſaid unto the poor, weak, and ignorant by them, is voted for good, commended and applauded they ſpeak well of them that know them not; for many do live by the rule of cuſtome, and ſo the Miniſter is honoured more out of ignorance and cuſtome, or for ſome preingagements, then any other way elſe but forſowing of pillowes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3 Furthermore, beſides Tin mixing with metals, it doth alſo beautifie other metalls, it doth put a fairer gloſſe and luſter upon metals, then they have of themſelves, it becomes as a coat or a cloake on them, as for example, Tin covering braſſe makes it very like Silver, as that we call Alkemy, how many have been deceived by this ſort of contrived metals, in veſſels, inſtruments, and in coine, taking it for good Silver when being Braſſe, it hath onely a coat of Tin upon it. Thus doth the Clergy, they put another hue and countenance, upon the Magiſtracy, then they have of themſelves: their aſſociating with them, their frequent converſing with them, their diſcourſing with them, and their advizing, and counſelling of them, makes the world, ſeeing their familiarity, to judge them to be as they are, which ſuppoſe to be the pure metall of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo as in their judgement they conceive well of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118099:20"/>
the Miniſter, ſo do they of the men in Authority, becauſe are together often in converſe, and in diſcourſe; Thus the world comes to be deceived, to build their confidence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hay and ſtubble, which the fire will conſume, although the praiſe the miniſter giveth, makes the party the more in reſpect; it is but of the men of the world: but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God knoweth the heart, and that one doth ſpoil and corrupt the other:<note place="margin">Eſa. 5.20.</note> for the Miniſters, as well as the old falſe prophets, are apt to call evil good, and good evill, and ſo there is a wo pronounced againſt them.</p>
            <p>Again, Tin it doth beautifie iron, and makes it ſeem as Tin, by which iron, we underſtand the worldling, he that is nothing but Iron, that regardeth nothing but the world and the profits of it, it makes him ſeem to be that he is not, to be as the Tin is, that is, like his Preacher, and his teacher, witneſſe many wretched worldlings, whoſe intimacy with their Preachers,<note place="margin">Amos. 3.3.</note> their reſorting to him, their familiar ſociety, walking and talking with them, as agreed, makes the people of the world to take them for no worſe then their Preachers, although like Iron, they be never ſo hard and cruell, lying as iron in the earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the earth hath turned them to earth; Thus doth the Miniſtry, for their worldly ends, keep company with the men of the world, as long as they live, and ſometimes before they die, like Ravens about a beaſt, they viſit him often for their prey ſake; and when they are dead, they put an eternall fame upon them, worth ſometimes five pounds: This good man, this juſt and upright man, this man that loved the word; a conſtant hearer, and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church, and the Ordinances of God, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the poor, as appeareth at his death: he is now in Heaven, after which, if a monument of him <hi>pietas, virtus, ſanctus,</hi> if not, <hi>ſanctiſſimus, &amp;c.</hi> muſt be part of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph: and ſo the miniſters doe not only verniſh, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the worldlings, and the corrupt minded here while living, but indeavor to perpetuate, and eternize their fame, and all this for the ſucceding expectation of the like reward: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> became all things, to all men,

that he might gain ſome, that is, ſome to Chriſt, into the houſe of God, into the Kingdom; but ſhame it is that Miniſters are become all things to all men, that they might gain ſome of the world with them, but to gain them to God, to Chriſt, if a ſermon or two, once or twice a week will do it, well, if not what care they: they look for their fleece, and therefore they do with their people of eminence, as ſervants that flatter their maſters, fearing their frownes, and that they ſhall be loſers, if they ſpeak out their mindes really, and not to their maſters affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to his gaine being asked, is this well don; though perhaps ill don; yea ſay they, it is well done or otherwiſe if they ſay it is beſt, or may it be lawfull for me, to do thus or thus, though perhaps unlawfull, ſaies the ſervant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his maſters affection, and the purpoſe of his minde; yea, you may lawfully do it: if otherwiſe that the maſter be croſt, away then; if they ſpeak contrary to their mindes and waies.

            <p>Laſtly, it doth colour and ſet a gloſſe upon the earth, it makes that to ſhine: for all the earthen veſſels,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> that are ſhining white veſſels, they are made ſo with Tin very fair, clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And thus the Almighty God is mocked, by a company of poor ſoules, that know not what they doe: Yet by the report of their miniſter, they are good Chriſtians, he dawbes with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered morter, and laies a little of his Tin upon them and ſo they paſſe for currant.

            <p>Aagain, Tin is a dry metall, and by reaſon of its dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when it is bended it will creek, thoſe that are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſts know this, that Tin of all metalls is dry: Shall it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118099:21"/>
be ſaid that the Clergy is ſo, it may be ſaid they are dry and thirſty too; their drineſſe appeares that they have but little good within them, and their thirſt declares that they would draw what they could to them: for their dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it appears by their charity, peace, contentation and humility, let them examine themſelves, I would none of them, were to be blamed, but found to be Sions builders, yet being my duty, I muſt ſpeak what I know and have found them to be; I charge not all, that are or have, the name of Miniſters, but the corrupt ones they are uncharitable, contentious, greedy, proud, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting ſome there are; I would ſet down their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if I could perceive any, they are quite dry of all goodneſſe. But this is not all, they are thirſty, that is, they are covetous, their deſire above all is large, for they deſire rich Benefices, fair houſes, farmes, dairies, land, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſtore of tithes, all mens good will, their ſervants, their cattell, their gold, and ſilver, what not: if theſe be not like Tin in its drineſſe, then no men are: But they are ſo, and therefore the Lord will melt-them. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that in the Temple, there was much Gold &amp; Silver, Braſſe, and Iron uſed, but no Tin: in the new heaven,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.1.</note> and new earth that coms dowen from God, there will be no Tin: this Tin was never found but where Apoſtacy was, and when Almighty God, removeth away our Apoſtacy, then will he take away all our Tin.</p>
            <p>Again, Tin, when it is bended, it will creek, and cry, it makes a noiſe, and by that ſigne many knowes it to be Tin, and different from mixt metals; will Tin, when it is bowed and bended creek and cry? And what do the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, when things goes contrary to their outward peace and welfare, how do they cry till a deliverance comes, till a repair is made; this is ſufficiently experienced, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſhifts they uſe? above all men, that loſt in the late warrs, they were ſooneſt repaired; they will not ly long in a trouble, or in adverſity, but they will cry to their gods, whether favourers of Epiſcopacy, or Presbytery, they are ſure to ſpeed, rather then not, they will paſſe upon them a

Romiſh ſentence, which ſome poor Ignoramuſſes, ſtand in fear of, and helpes them; out of his tender minde: (ſaith he) a miniſter of the Goſpell!

            <p>What a do is there now, with the Clergy, there is news that their kingdom is at end, that there is no need of them, that they are Seducers, and Deceivers, that they preach for hire, here is a great matter to bow them, and bend them, to make them creek and cry: and do they not? Survey their demeanour under this ſtrange Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: they do cry out amain, they travell much, they ſpend their ſpirits much more then they did; having mended their pace, they ſay we are all undone, if this light do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. If they cannot blow it out, they cry for help, help Judge, help Magiſtrate, help Juſtice, help Lawyer, help common men, help poor, help rabble and raſcality: (I had almoſt forgot) they cry for help to their God too, and that at all publike occaſions and meetings: (I cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them that the almighty God will hear them,) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome men of authority do hear them: my advice is from the Lord to them, Let all fleſh be ſilent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,<note place="margin">Zach. 2.13.</note> for he is raiſed out of his holy place:</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Tin, it will receive any impreſſion eaſily: <hi>Filius Dei</hi> was once ſtampt on the clergy, when the ſons of <hi>Levi:</hi> Since, was <hi>Jure Divino</hi> on ſome; &amp; on others, ſuch a Lords Chaplain. They were at the beginning only Prophets, and Prieſts, but of late, they have been (leaving out the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catalogue) Biſhops, Doctours, Bachelours, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; As Tin will eaſily receive any ſtamp, cognizance, or badge, ſo will the Clergy, imbrace any place or name, any title whatſoever, to make their benefit great; Yet in all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118099:22"/>
this, and notwithſtanding all other impreſſions, they claim the old ſtamp, <hi>Filius Dei:</hi> although they be not Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but a mixt deceiveable metal, ſo that they are in the world like unto bad coine: which when ſome ſee the ſtamp, they own the peece for good; being afterwards, upon better view, or advice of others found to be bad, and that no experienced party will meddle with it for good, as it ſo paſt before, then there is a ſtir and a miſchief, being a loſſe and a detriment to him, that received and took it for good: Even ſo the ſtudied doctrines, and ſpeeches, which is ſqueeſed through the corrupt braines of ſome called Divines, and brought through multitudes of words of Art, Eloquence, and Philoſophy, which is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the minde of God, who is the Eternal, and moſt holy God; make much miſchief in the world, among the ſons of men, now. Inſomuch that men that are truly and purely inlightened, will not medle with it, and likewiſe doth forbid their brethren, to have any thing to do with it, knowing and underſtanding, how formerly they were at a loſſe by it, and that ſhortly all ſuch, yea ſuch baſe mixtures, and deceiveable coine, ſhall be called in by the Great Supreme Commander, who will melt it, and refine it, (for there is little baſe coine but Tin is in it.)</p>
            <p>Again, as Tin will receive any impreſſion, ſo it will not hold the hammering, it is not malleable, it will not indure ſtrokes, as other metals, but it will break, and tear. So will the Clergy, when any ſtroke comes upon them, it rents them from their people, they then forſake their flock; reduce a hundred to fifty, they are gone: They will not be pliable to yeeld to the perſwaſions of any, but of their own Tribe, and rather then they would turn, they would if their power might, limit God, the Holy One of Iſrael; and do now breathe out impoſſibilities of things, that will come to paſſe, pleading; That this corrupted, defiled, and Apoſtate Church now being,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.6.</note> is the very true Church of God, and that they are, as the Apoſtles in the Primitive times were, and that whoſoever doth forſake them, forſakes their mother, and that there is no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

in departing away from them to be expected; for that that is out of it, concerning Gods worſhip, is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, and abominable, (Can the vote of a Synod, be ſuch a vote, if there were one) I doubt it? for the ſober modeſt Preacher, and the rebaptized, conclude that the Church viſible, is not cleanſed as it ſhould be, or may be: if it were, then <hi>Quorſum haec diſpendia,</hi> what means all this ſtir, more then ever? what meanes the complaints, ſuch various Judgements and Opinions? what means ſo ſo much burnings, one againſt another? enquire out the author, and the cauſe of it: Is not God by this, beginning to refine his people is not he a gathering of his people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that were ſcattered, doth not the great day of the Lord, begin to dawn? But I am ſpeaking to them, that care not to hear; for of all men, the worſt man, is a bad Miniſter, (the Schools will ſay that). I know not, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are the worſt, except it be in matter of turning. It is a ſad thing for a Leader to retreat, for a Teacher, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teach, for a miniſter to change, Oh no, it is againſt his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. The good Propher <hi>Jona</hi> was faulty in this, but what became of him, you may read, a heavy puniſhment: the like ſad things, may come upon ſuch, as now raile, revile, and perſecute, thoſe men that now ſay, that the Lord will ſuppreſſe all the teachings of men, and that there is a light, in every man, that directs him to obedience: ſhall poor vile wretched man, ſay out of his unbelief, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not this way bring men to himſelf: but it muſt be, by the ancient Apoſtatized way? be ſilent for ever, and let God alone, in his moſt wonderfull Changings.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Tin is a metall that will conſume by fire, and come to aſhes contrary to other metals, Gold and Silver will not conſume; neither will Braſſe conſume by fire, waſte it will. But Tin will ſuddenly be conſumed, and then all the luſter, the glory and brightneſſe of it is gone, and cannot appear any more, happy were it, that the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Lord, as they call themſelves, were as Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that their luſter might continue, as ſhall the luſter and glory of the Word, the Son of God: But there is a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118099:23"/>
time of fading, periſhing, and conſuming of all the glory of Tin, and ſo there will be, of all the Shinings, Gloſſings, Gliſterings, Soundings, Likeneſſes, Adulterations, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, Mixings, Coverings, &amp; Impreſſions, which are not purely of &amp; from the Lord: but begotten in the corrupt minde, artificially, through the skill of vain man beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, adorned, and ſet out as the glory of the eternall God, ſeeming to be as the Lords golden candleſticks;<note place="margin">The aſhes of Tin ſerves to ſcour iron, ſtone, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</note> but the Lord will conſume all with the breath of his mouth, and make the aſhes of it, as the aſhes of Tin ſerveth, to clear and to make bright other veſſels, inſtruments and tools which may ſerve in his houſe for the future.</p>
            <p>Hear then, all you that boaſt of your callings, that are not called of the Lord, as <hi>Paul</hi> he ſaith, that he was by the will of God, and not by the will of man; you (I ſay) that are called by the will of man, and of men, to be ſpeakers, and teachers, or miniſters, know this, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the Miniſter of reconciliation, and the onely teacher of his people, and you are the intruders among his people, taking up that liberty to your ſelves that belongeth not to you; being you know not what you ſay, nor the word you ſpeak, nor the Goſpel that you profeſſe, and pretend you preach to the world; for the Goſpel is hid to them that periſh, and if you be in that periſhing and conſuming condition, wo be to you from the Lord. Deceive not your ſelves in theſe laſt times, wherein God in great love comes to manifeſt himſelf unto his: think not that the old veſſels of Tin can now ſtand, that hath held all manner of moſt filthy poiſon for this many yeers, and that the boaſting of bare ignorance &amp; hypocriſie can uphold them. Hath not the outward viſible Church, ſince the primitive Saints, been apoſtatized and corrupted this many hundred yeers? Do you conceive that the lopping of ſome boughs off the tree, that hath ever ſince brought forth bad fruit, will ſerve the turn? No, no, the tree it ſelf muſt be cut down and caſt into the fire, the corrupt and droſſie metals muſt be refined. This the Almighty will do, he will gather his jewels and his wheat, his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118099:24"/>
Saints, he will gather them together, and there ſhall be one Shepherd, and one ſheepfold, there ſhall be no more hirelings that do forſake the ſheep when the woolfe cometh, for fear of their own perſons; but the Lord God will be their everlaſting light and defence, amidſt all their enemies.</p>
            <p>Is it Gods complaint, that his people are Tin? it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all to look about, although by his Prophets he complains onely againſt the Prophets that ſinned againſt him, and alſo the Prieſts for their behaviour towards him and his people, as by the reſemblance of tin is at large ſet forth; yet other people, inclining to the wayes of the Prophets and the Prieſts, are herein alſo concerned: Some there are that put their truſt and confidence in the ſayings and doings of others for themſelves, and not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to romage their inner man, to get a teſtimony of their own; but rely on the preaching, praying, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God, by thoſe Prophets and Prieſts lips, being content to hazard their eternall welfare, not caring in their inward and inviſible part, to anſwer and obey the light that acquaints them with their condition, and ſo live without the evidence and aſſurance of their eternall welfare. Fools and blinde, can you be content to lie down, and be ſatisfied with the bare name of Chriſtians, and not prove your ſelves to be ſo in very deed? You ſhould work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </note> but, like <hi>Felix,</hi> you do not care for to tremble, you will hear of that another time, and ſo put it off untill you have no time left, and then your trembling ſhall have no end; let not your religion be of that ſort, that hath no union, or communion with God;<note place="margin">Matth. 5.13.</note> if it be ſo, it is like that ſalt that is unſavoury, that is not good for any thing, but for the dunghill: but let your religion be that of the Saints of old, that could ſay, The Lord is my habitation. When we can truly ſay, I finde Chriſt liveth in me, then ſhall we be able to draw concluſions of Gods love in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, either of proſperity, or adverſity, and in it ſhall behold with great joy, through the Croſſe, our dignity
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118099:24"/>
that we are called the ſons of God: then ſhall we finde within our ſelves the pure ſalt that preſerveth us, being in the fleſh, as naturall ſalt doth keep fleſh from tainting, ſo ſhall we be kept holy and blameleſſe, till the coming of the Lord.</p>
            <p>In the third place, let us ſee how Iſrael is Iron, and how the people of traffique, Merchants, men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and trade, their exerciſe being to the ſupport of their Nation, City, Town, or place, where they dwell or inhabit, are reſembled to iron.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Iron is a metall that is very hard and ſtrong, and is of very great uſe to the main buſineſſe of the world, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating various and ſundry kindes of ſeverall ſervices and uſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is a metal, that notwithſtanding its ſtrength and ſerviceableneſſe, is ſubject above all metals to ruſt, to loſe not onely his beauty and colour, but to loſe its ſtrength; yea, utterly all, and its very ſubſtance changed and turned into earth.</p>
            <p>This metall of iron, there is no dealing with it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fire, and with the fire it is very yeelding, to the bringing forth, or making of any inſtrument, tool, or thing whatſoever is neceſſary for building, fencing, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, foiling, ſecuring, drawing, cutting, hammering, delving, plowing, and all kindes of working, inſomuch that there is no buſineſſe concerning the world, but there, to the doing of that buſineſſe, iron, and things and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made of iron, both on the land and on the ſea are attending.</p>
            <p>The which doth ſet forth unto us the great buſineſſe and ſervice that the men of the world doth, as in the world, and to and for the love and ſake of the world one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: by them many great deſignes and enterpriſes are brought to paſſe of merchandizing, and trading, and commerce; as alſo much manufactory, husbandry, til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and labours, wherein is ſeen to the outward, the great providence of God in the world, in diſpoſing of all the affairs of men, in their outward adventures and their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118099:25"/>
more hard labours; ſome men ſitting ſtill, and living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the adventures and labours of others, and others la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and endevouring themſelves with much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to maintain themſelves.</p>
            <p>Is iron a very hard and ſtrong metall? So are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of trade and merchandiſe, and all other ſignified by iron; they are hard, not eaſily plied and bowed, they are hard in their bargains, dealings, hirings, and paying of wages; they are ſtrong, for they have great ſubſtance, much art and cunning, and do gain great profits, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and inheritances, having the exerciſe of buying and ſelling all commodities uſefull for men.</p>
            <p>As the Lord doth complain againſt them he ſets up in authority, and againſt his Prophets; ſo doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt others of his people, who were ſet by him, and appointed in callings, to furniſh the Nations with things convenient for the outward neceſſity of man, and here ſayes they are iron, they are as hard as iron, they will not ply (ſaith the Lord) nor bow to me, but are a ſtiff-necked people, a ſtubborn and a gain-ſaying people, a people that have deaf ears, blinde eyes, hard hearts, as deaf as the deaf adder, that will not hear the voice of the Charmer charm he never ſo wiſely; that walk according to the ſtubbornneſſe of their own hearts, and their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious wils and underſtandings; and ſuch Chriſt ſpake of in his time, They will not come to me that they might have life: and others that will not come to the feaſt, they are ſet and reſolved, and firmly determine, they will not yeeld, ſubmit, and bow. And as they are hard and ſtiff, that they will yeeld no obedience to God, ſo likewiſe they are hard and cruell to their brethren in their bargains and dealings, eſpecially to their poor; they have no reſpect to equity, but to great gain, and herein they do uſe lying, deceit, guil, over-reaching, and oppreſſion, the one to the other; and as the more hard iron doth cut the ſoft iron, and makes it to be fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for uſes and purpoſes, ſo doth the hard and cruell man, he cuts his neighbour not onely in his outſide, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118099:25"/>
in his very inward, nay, to the taking of away the very marrow of his poor neighbours bones: they are hard and cruell in their hiring of poor men, waiting and taking all the advantages that may be, to ſcrew them and bring them to work ſo low, that they cannot maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor their families: they are hard in paying of wages, concerning the time and the place, not when they moſt need, or at the moſt convenient place, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to the worſt every way, to make them the more ſerviceable and tendable upon them. Some there be that do abate the poor man of his wages, or pay him in bad coin, or bad commodity. Thus, thus do the people deal that are ſignified by iron, and reſembled to iron, wherein large complaints might be made againſt them.</p>
            <p>Again, they are ſtrong, they have great ſubſtance and much art; they are ſtill gaining great profits, inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and lands, having the exerciſe of buying and ſelling. God made man righteous, but he hath ſought out many inventions; herein, in the traffique, merchandiſe, and trading of the world, is ſeen much of the wickedneſſe of men: Firſt, man makes himſelf ſtrong by owning other gods, he is ſtrong in his own might, making his merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, his trade, or his calling to be as his god; in it he puts his confidence and his truſt more then in God. I would I could not ſay it, but true it is, that the worldly man doth put his truſt in his merchandiſe, in his trade, in his husbandry in his manufactory, in his cunning, in his craft, in his deceit: hence it is, that ſome places and houſes, that are and have been, are called houſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; it is a very ſad thing being well conſidered that any man ſhould profeſſe himſelf to be a Chriſtian, and relie, confide, and wholly put his truſt in his outward calling for the ſupport and maintaining of his family, not truſting God in the leaſt, but to wall in, to himſelf, all poſſible things within his own reach, to his viſible eye, for to er e him not onely from wanting, but to get an eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to make him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf great by deceit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, man becomes ſtrong when he hath attained
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118099:26"/>
his own deſires, and brought to paſſe his own ends. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to be rich (being accompliſhed) makes the heart as ſtrong as iron; for reaſon gives to man, that if once he hath gotten, he may keep what he hath gotten, and ſo poor blinde man, having gotten a ſubſtance, doth glory in it, and boaſt of it, it may be not without ſome verball ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the bleſſing of God to him in his trade, or his way that he did exerciſe himſelf in: But he is ſtrong, he is able for great undertakings, and to give aſſiſtance to others; he is ſtrong, fearing no change, no alteration, he hath enough to maintain himſelf and his, he is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to any, others are to him; he is ſtrong concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the noble atchievements, in bringing about great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, whereby many poor is ſet on work, much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as to the livelihoods of many, is generated and born out of his care and caſting about in the ſeverall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of himſelf, that it is merit ſufficient for him to do ſo much publike good, crying peace to himſelf, in the ſatisfaction of his earthly minde, that becauſe of his conceived publike good he doth, carrying a greater coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance then other mens buſineſſe doth in the world, he bleſſeth himſelf in his own imagination, &amp; ſo becoms ſtrong, but not according as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, man becomes ſtrong in his own conceit, that after he hath gained an eſtate, and is the means of much employment of others to get their living, then man comes to preferment, to honour and dignity, to have many friends, to have all men to ſpeak well of him, and to be friendly to him, to afford him any ſervice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to praiſe him and to pray for him: <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, The rich have many friends, but the poor is hated of his neighbour: the worldly rich man, what can he deſire more: when he hath gotten that that makes him ſtrong, he needs not to fear, nor to be afraid what evil can come to him; he is ſafe, he is well provided for, (as the word is.) Thus we ſee how worldly men, rich men, are of the ſtrength of iron, ſtrong every way to their hearts deſire;

ſurely theſe ſtrong men may be concerned in the ſpeech of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.22.</note> when the ſtrong man keeps the houſe all things are at peace; but when a ſtronger than he cometh upon him, then he taketh from him all his armour wherein he truſted, and divideth his ſpoils: when men come to attain, beſides the worldly contentments, ſome inward peace that nothing doth diſturb them, diſquiet them, or ail them, then they are ſtrong and able in their own imagination, to overthrow power, to vanquiſh all things that ſhall riſe up againſt them: Even then in the height of all this, there is ſorrow in the midſt of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, weakneſſe in the midſt of ſtrength. There is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling power and ſtrength that ſees the folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, to think themſelves ſtrong, and wiſe, and rich, when they are weak, fooliſh, and poor; for God will blaſt all the ſtrength of men, and they ſhall know that the Lord is onely ſtrong.</p>
            <p>Again, as iron is a metall of great uſe &amp; much ſtrength, ſo it is a metall that is very ſubject to ruſt, and to come to earth again.</p>
            <p>Iron is a metall that will not mix with other metals, yet it may be gilded, ſilver'd, and tinn'd: workmen do make many ſundry ſorts of things of iron, the which is gilded, and ſilver'd, and tinn'd.</p>
            <p>That iron which is gilded, doth ſet out to us thoſe worldly people, men of the world that are very high in profeſſion and in ſeeming practice, as if they were the very ſons of God, and of theſe men now, there is the greateſt talk and the greateſt ſtir, and the greateſt plague will fall upon them; for they are not as the threeſcore queens that <hi>Salomon</hi> in the Canticles ſpeaks of, but as the four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>core Concubines, they are in ſhew ſuch as are married to the Lord, that are eſpouſed to him; but in truth they love other gods beſides, therefore they are iron for its ſtrength, and as gilded iron in re pect of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fair ſhew among men: I would our Nation had but a few of theſe, leſſe than fourſcore, but I fear there are thouſands ſpeaking according to the capacity of men.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118099:27"/>
Would there were not thouſands of them among the Presbyterians. But what ſhall I name them? may not there be ſome among the Independants, among the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized Churches, and among the people called Quakers; theſe people compared to gilded iron are not to be found otherwhere; for they have proteſted againſt the common Proteſtant and Epiſcopaliſt, beſides all other religions of that ſort. O wo, wo, wo from the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch that have ſuch coſtly and golden coverings, and meer iron within, that ſeem above other profeſſours and practiſers, not onely to be changed, but to be ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized; not onely to be civilized, but to be (as it were) deified. Theſe, theſe are hypocrites with a witneſſe, which the Lord is now ſhewing to the world, he is unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and taking away their gilt, and they ſhall ſhew and appear what their inſide is: Theſe are the worſt of all men, like to the Devil, that can transform himſelf into an Angel of light; of theſe I will ſay no more, but what is ſaid of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. For if we ſin willingly after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a fearfull looking for of judgement, and violent fire which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the adverſary.<note place="margin">Heb. 6.4, 6, 7, &amp;c.</note> Again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. there are terrible things for the Apoſtate.</p>
            <p>Again, that iron which is ſilver'd, are another ſort of profeſſours in the world, who are not upon ſo high a ſtrain as the other, but yet they are not according to their ſhew, they are as <hi>Martha</hi> was, that was cumbered with much buſineſſe, but <hi>Mary</hi> had choſen the better part, which ſhall never be taken away, the gold and the ſilver, that is as a covering to iron, ſhall by means of lying on the iron wear away; for the iron will ſhew it ſelf, and break tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row its covering: Theſe ſorts of people are a worldly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple but yet they are full of the Word in their mouths, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, talking of God, his word, and of religion; but they have not the power of it in their hearts, they are onely in ſhew; for theſe do perſecute people that live in the power and life of what they do profeſſe, which doth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118099:27"/>
manifeſt by that, that they are enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt. To be Silver without, and Iron within, is much like to that fooliſh builder, not building his houſe on a Rock, but on the Sands; when the windes came, and the rain fell, it blaſted not onely the glory of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but the very houſe it ſelfe fell, for when the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of affliction comes, it weares away the ſilvering, and then the Iron that ruſteth, and becomes earth, and ſo all is worth nothing?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Iron is ſubiect above all metalls to ruſt, and ſo looſes not onely his beauty and his colour, but alſo his ſtrength yea his very ſubſtance, for by lying in the earth, it is turned unto earth.</p>
            <p>Iron, never ſo well cleaned and beautified, will loſe his colour, let it be from the fire, the fire doth preſerve it ſtanding, or being uſed neer it. So long as the fire of God anger is neer the worldling, ſo long is he of a bright hue, and countenance, and ſome appearance of God is in him: But when his corrupt heart, joyneth it ſelf to earth, or to the waters, that is to lie in the earth, in his earthly and carnall minde, and not be brought out of it, but there remains ſtill, in its own element, it becomes afterwards, to be very earth it ſelf, by ruſting in it.</p>
            <p>How is the worldling by loving the world, cleaving to it, and delighting in it, loving it with all his heart, with all his minde, with all his ſoul, with all his ſtrength exerciſing all his underſtanding, art, cunning, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in the proſecution of it, adding more and more to his deſire, and to his endeavours ſtill unſatisfied? ſo that in the end, he becomes infinite in his deſires being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bounds, or limits, no word or counſell can reſtrain him, but colours the unmeaſurable deſire, of ſtill obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the ſhew of good husbandry, and thrift, and therein thinks he doth God good ſervice, in the exerciſing of his talent, and pleads for his moſt covetous and wretched practiſes, which is the height of all wickednes, to plead for it, and to defend it, againſt all the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118099:28"/>
that can be urged: So that the lying in this earthly minde and will, without any remorſe at all, makes him to be very earth, he is eaten up and devoured of his own earthly, ſenſuall, and worldly purſuings, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God in him, neither of Religion, being thus cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, hence it comes to paſſe, that being preſent at any meeting, where any thing of God is ſpoken, though he be preſent in body, he is abſent in minde, and either his minde wanders, &amp; his thoughts runs out into the world, or elſe heavie, and ſleepy, in ſuch places, and at ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, declaring plainly, that he hath no love at all to God, his Word, or Religion; the talke of it is tedious to him, he cannot bear it; it is to him, as an unſavoury, or an unreliſhable diſh of meat, being offenſive to him, it muſt be taken from him; or elſe he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
            <p>Lamentable is the caſe of worldlings, in reſpect of their loving the treaſure of the world; whereas being men made with a face directed to look upward, they look downwards, alwaies groveling in the earth like beaſts. And this is not all; but there are ſome, who live and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves, in the pride and pleaſure of the world: what the world affords them, they do embrace it, and make their chief delight and joy in it: the proud man that is proud of his eſtate, means, lands, livings, friends, or his place or office is here concernd, in this reſemblance of iron, and he living here, in the onely ſervice of his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and high minde, ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ancing himſelf above others, and thinking himſelf, in his proud conceit, to be better then others, ſtaveth off from himſelf all good, counſell to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, that in the end he is ſwallowed up, into ſuch an extream deluge of pride, being hardened in it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will work upon him; his ruſt and filth of his proud minde doth devour him. The like may be ſaid of ſuch as give themſelves up wholly to pleaſure, and can ſee no benefit at all to themſelves, but onely the pleaſure; yea, the pleaſure that the world yeeldeth them, that they take as their portion, and dreams of a Heaven that is of ſuch
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118099:28"/>
like condition. Beware oh ye that love pleaſure more then God, for your end is damnation, and while you live thus, not owning God, or the pleaſure: and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of His countenance, you are ſo ruſted with lying in pleaſure, that nothing but earth, and the tranſitorineſſe of that pleaſure ſhall be your reward, and are devoured by that wherein your fleſh delighted.</p>
            <p>Doth God complain that his people are Iron, great cauſe there is for it, for the greateſt part of the world are as Iron, hard and ſtiffe cruel and ſtrong, worldly, covetous, proud, and living in pleaſure; conſider this ye that do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you, although you are as ſtrong, and as hard as Iron, the Lord can finde away to weaken and ſoften you, the fire of his wrath will do it, there is nothing too hard for the Lord: hath he ſaid and ſhall it not be done. Break off therefore your ſins by repentance, and your iniquities by ſhewing of mercy: be liberall and bountifull in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of what God hath given you to the poor make not the earth your own, it is the Lords, and he giveth it to the ſons of men, Boaſt not of any worldly thing, it is all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, your wiſdom, your ſtrength, your riches, honour and dignity, and all ſhall paſſe away as a vaine thing.<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.</note>

            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, let us ſee how Iſrael is ſaid to be Lead, in the poor, mean, and people of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>Lead is a metal that is ſoft and waighty, it is pliable, and will receive any impreſſion, and it hath ſilver contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, not to be ſeen: it is alſo malleable:</p>
            <p>Of all the former metals, this hath the leaſt eſteem yet the beſt metall, conſidering the good qualities of it, being ſoft, and pliable, and retaining ſomething of ſilver.</p>

               <hi>David</hi> when he ſaw the proſperity of the wicked, he was caſt down, and thought he had cleanſed himſelf in vain, But afterwards, when he had been at the Sanctuary of God, he underſtood, &amp;c. and ſaid, Thou wilt guide me with thy counſell, and after that receive me to Glory; In this, let us learn of the poor, and be poor in ſpirit, for they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God: the poor takes any impreſſion, call him what you will, he is not angry neither offended; ſo ſhould it be with us, take all manner of wrongs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries patiently, not ſeeking revenge, but be Mal eable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hammer of God, to be beaten, and faſhioned to what he will have us to be.</p>
            <p>Again, Lead is waighty, and in that quality it is like Gold, for that is the weightieſt of all metals. But this lead being a waighty and heavie metall, it ſerveth in the world to make weights, wherewith moſt commodities that are ſold by weight, are weighed and ballanced. So are they, the poor of the world, they are as the weights wherewith the dealings of men, one with another, and towards themſelves, are by them weighed, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all their unjuſt actions, their oppreſſions, fraud, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and hard dealing is by them ſeen, and felt, and known more then to others; for by ſuch means, men are made poor, and kept ſo: and therefore the preſſure of it lying on them chiefly, it is by them weighed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and alſo by them judged, cenſured, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,</p>
            <p>Lead alſo is waighty in another reſpect, and that is in reſpect of the poor themſelves, being heavie, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, to the places, they are and do remain in: ſome of them, being aged, lame, impotent and blind, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute; theſe poor are chargeable, and burdenſome, and ſuch as theſe, are alwaies in the world, and to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for.</p>
            <p>Thete is alſo poor that are vagarants, rogues, theeves,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118099:30"/>
and poor priſoners; the which are troubleſome, to the Common Wealth, and burdenſome where they are; theſe the civil Magiſtrate ſhould take in hand to reſtrain, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and ſuppreſſe:</p>
            <p>Here we ſee, that the poor here underſtood by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Lead, are of two kindes, the one are very flexible, and tractable, and doth reſemble the ſilver, that is in the Lead, as it lies in the droſſy body unſeen.</p>
            <p>The other poor is as the droſſey body of the Lead, which muſt by refining be brought to a ſeparation, forth from the Silver, and ſo the one makes a veſſell for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finer, and the other is as a weighty, and burdenſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world.</p>
            <p>Take Lead as it is in the originall, and ye cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Silver to be in it. So the poor; they are ſuch that have ſome graces, and diſcoveries of God unto them, but they cannot ſhew it; they are ſo trampled on by the men the world, and kept low, in a deſpiſed, forlorne, and mean condition, that they cannot exerciſe their graces as they ſhould, it lies inwardly in the heart, and doth not appear outwardly; This is the condition of many, and yet the rich juſtifie themſelves very much, by the carriages of the poor, being contrary to them; for they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent publike preaching, and uſe long prayers, pay their dues, ſpeak the truth without avowing, and do acts of charity, being ſober, and chaſt outwardly, whereby it comes to paſſe, that the rich man in his demeanor, and carriage bleſſeth himſelf that he is not ſuch a one as the poor, like the proud Phariſee, that did thank God he was not as other men, he did faſt twiſe a week, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is a great difference between them; the rich can very well ſpare the time, to be ſeen of men, and ſpend much in the outward viſible matter of ſervice, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing troubles him, all things is in ſtore for his uſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking after it. But the poor man, he muſt get his bread, and be imployed, at all ſeaſons, for that end, to have to ſuſtain nature: but ſeeing the difference, he crieth to the Lord, from his heart, <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:118099:30"/>
and ſo getteth inward comfort, and ſolace, though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly he cannot ſhew it to the world.</p>
            <p>Other poor, that is ſignified by Lead, being parted from the Silver, is that fort of poor, that are wicked: of theſe there are, that are mockers, raylers, revilers and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal perſecutours, ſlanderers of men in high places, for good acts of Juſtice, Piety, and Charity, having nor the fear of God before their eyes: they are ready to do any evill, as coadjutors to others, being thereunto engaged, wherein men of eminence, outwardly civil, forbear in their own perſons, and force and compell thoſe poor whom they can command. And thus the deſignes of evil men, are brought to paſſe, and executed as in theſe dayes, againſt the pure people of God, who are drawn from the the common practice of the world, to live more neerer with God, and to commune with him, out of the worlds ordinances; theſe are much abuſed and mocked.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe poor are ſuch, that are diſcontented that they are poor, falling from one wickedneſſe to another, and moſt rudely do abuſe the Name of God, his people, his creatures, and all the things of God, impatient, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, and charging of God, for aflicting them; ſome, as it hath been heard ſay, ſaid: Could God do more to me then he hath done? ſome alſo that were before,<note place="margin">A poor man at Cardiffe.</note> of ſome ability and means, having loſt it, are moved through the inſtigation of the evill One, to rage and foment evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Maker; for that they have not, as heretofore, to carry on the deſires of their luſtfull hearts, into that, they formerly lived in?</p>
            <p>There are alſo poor that are idle, lazy, and ſwiniſh, that are as monſters among men, and the very ſhame, of nature, by their moſt filthy, naſty, and beaſtly behaviour, who are nor worthy the name of men, and women, who takes no care, neither will they be adviſed, and ruled by any good perſwaſion, or deſire the ſame: but like brute beaſts, which have no underſtanding to ſeek after any thing that ſavours of civility, or humanity; for theſe, let our pity and grief, make future prevention, that no more

            <p>God will gather them: How will God gather them? He will gather them as men gather fruit,<note place="margin">2 King. 4 39. Geneſ. 31.46. Pſal. 106.47. Jerem 49.5.

            <p>Was the people of God a ſcattered people, and are they not ſo now? Were the true Iſraelites ſcattered, and are not the true Beleevers ſo now?

            <p>It muſt needs be, that the people and Saints of God, who live with God, walk with him, and commune with him inwardly, ſhould not be bound up to apoſtate forms, and Church ordinances outwardly, being not conſiſtent with the pure life of God, but as death they divide from them, &amp; are ſcattered from ſuch Church-fellowſhips that bring no true peace, having been taught to be eſſentiall, but now found to be only the name of an aſſociation, or agreement, when as there is nothing more then differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, diſſention, and confuſion, as Babel: Come our from among them, my people, ſaith the Lord, the holy One.

Thus it muſt be, the Lord God will ſave his, although it may be ſaid, Many paſtours, many teachers have deſtroyed and diſtracted thee.

But before this is really accompliſhed, and brought to paſſe, there may be much perſecution, occaſioned by them who are the upholders of Antichriſt, in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed way of a religion, patched up in theſe times of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie: which cannot endure to hear of the fiery change, that ſhall come, which will burn up all Envie, ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſſe, pride, ſelf-love, ambition, diſcord and ſtrife, and bring us to that pure love, that ſhall ever the Saints badge,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.5, 6, 7, 8.</note> and cognizance, as in the firſt of John, Chapter the fourth.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, God will melt them, God will melt his people, as men melt Braſſe, and Tin, and Iron, and Lead.

            <p>Here the people of God, are as metall,<note place="margin">Jer. 38.6. Rom. 9.21.</note> in the hands of the founder: in other places of Holy writ, they are as clay, in the hands of the potter, and he hath power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
            <p>As clay is made ſoft by water, and ſo is wrought, and made to what faſhion the potter pleaſeth: So are metals made ſoft by fire, ſome having a more ſtrong fire, then the others, according to their ſeverall qualities; and caſt, wrought, and made up by the workman, in what faſhion, he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Even ſo it is with the Lord; he can melt us and caſt us, frame us and forme us, into what faſhion, or condition he pleaſeth.</p>

Thinke on this, O man: of the great love of God, to thee, what ſatifaction could the whole world give, for the Redemption of one ſoul? and hath Chriſt Jeſus, equall to God his Father, purchaſed, Redemption for the whole world: and art thou ſo far from priſing it, that thou wilt not accept of it, but think to live happie without change, in thy naturall unclean, unpurified, and unrefined condition?

            <p>Let him, that hath ears to hear, hear: what the Lord hath ſaid. Know ye not that Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates, and except your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, you cannot enter: if you are the ſervants of ſin, your wages is death, if you live after the fleſh, you ſhall die, for they that are in fleſh, cannot pleaſe God, for the wiſdome of the fleſh, is death, but the wiſdom of the ſpirit is life, and peace: all that you can do, in the raw, unquoth, earthy, rough, droſſy, vain, darke, uncircumciſed, unprepared, and dead condition of nature, though never ſo much beautified, and adorned, with art learning, and outward wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and glory, it is but hypocriſie, we are onely Chriſtians portraied, and as it with a diamond, if not right, it is worth nothing; and as in a picture, if it be not

to the life, then it hath no regard: ſo, except we are really changed, and metamorphoſed, from that we were borne in, and are made like the Son of God, we are not free from the law of ſin, and death, but it hath power over us, to eternall death.</p>
            <p>Will the almighty God melt his people? let them be of what ſort ſoever? in their outward callings? either men of authority, men of the world, teaching men, or mean men? Then here, Behold, the great love of God unto you, he will will melt you, he will make you plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, tractable, and vertible, that what you cannot do your ſelves, he will do for you. Can the Leopard change his ſpots, or the Blackmore his skin, no more can a man change his nature of himſelf, or by any power within himſelf, but God onely is the changer of all; Are his people Braſſe, Tin, Iron, and Lead, ſuch metalls being of droſſy, earthy ſubſtances, and qualities that are not fit for his ſervice, that will be ſerved with Gold, and Silver? how then can theſe metalls be melted, and purified, and be made fit veſſels, for the Lord? They cannot melt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, neither is it in the power of one to melt another, no more can man be humbled, mollified, or be made capable, tractable, or vertible of himſelf, by himſelf, or by any other man, bur onely by the Lord himſelf who ſaith: <hi>I will melt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold then, I ſay, the goodneſſe, mercy, and love of God, that doth ſuch great things for us, as to melt us, himſelf! we are ſtill in his hands, we cannot do amiſſe, no hurt ſhall come to us, we have his preſence, his love, his bounty; although in the Furnace, he owns us, he will not depart from us, what greater love then this? to be with us when we have moſt need, when we have the bitter cup, preſented to us, then, then is our ſanctification neer, then the Lord is making of us like to Himſelf, and like to his Word, to be righteous, as he is righteous, pure as he is pure.</p>

            <p>Should there be ſuch a ſtrict ſurvey and enquiry made of the knowledge of God among us, we ſhould finde very few that do know God aright and truly, as they ought, and as the Saints of old did; but imaginarily by relation, by hear-ſay, and by writings. Who is it that knoweth God experimentally, not onely to be his Creatour, but to be his God? Who is there that ſheweth forth in a lively practice, that he was made to glorifie God, with and in his heart, minde, ſoul, and ſtrength? that doth witneſſe to the world, that all his members and ſences were deputed in their ſeverall orders and places, to honour and glorifie his Maker, and not to make them vaſſals and drudges in the ſervice of ſin and Satan? Who is there that doth exerciſe his affections in the things of God onely, that leapeth and danceth as <hi>David</hi> did, becauſe of the Ark of God,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.14.</note> that was recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought again among the people of God?

Are mens affections carried on, or off, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Gods will, as for the glory of God? Or are they ſet on the world, and carried on to the contrary, then there can be no true knowledge of God? Who is there,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118099:41"/>
that the paſſions of his minde bends to the glory of God, that is angry when the Lord is diſhonoured, his people abuſed, truth deſpiſed? Where is the zeal that <hi>David</hi> had,<note place="margin">Pſal. 69 9.</note> which did eat him up, he was not himſelf, his zeal had devoured him? Who is there that will adventure his life, liberty, goods, eſtate, credit, or reputation for God? If there be any ſuch, as are here enquired of, ſurely they know the Lord. And all others that live onely in the Heatheniſh nature, and run together with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, to do they know not what, and to they know not whom. The Lord will make as many as doth belong to him, to know him by his furnace, and acknowledge him to be juſt, holy, and good, as he hath declared himſelf to be, ſo ſhall his people finde in themſelves, if there were no Scripture, by their own teſtimony, which is the beſt evidence and proof: for no true knowledge can be, but by the inward teſtimony, other knowledge decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; for when men boaſt of their knowing God to be all-ſufficient, and that he knoweth beſt, what is fit for them, and if this be not radicall within, by inward teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, when trouble and affliction cometh, and the evil day approacheth, they are ready to murmure againſt God, and diſdain his dealings, whereby they teſtifie to their own hearts, their own failings, and that recoileth back that ſhould go forwards, witneſſing by their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency and unquiet ſpirits, that their knowledge of him was not true, neither can there be any thing true, but what will hold the fiery triall, that makes us to know the Lord, and to know our ſelves.</p>

to melt, refine, purifie, and purge out the droſſe, the filth and corruption, which lieth hidden and covered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, what ever metall-like ſhining there is, or what gilded profeſſion ſoever there is, or whatſoever art, or worldly wiſdom there is, there is nothing but death. To know God inwardly, ſavingly, experimentally, in all his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, in all his dealings, to know that his wrath here, &amp; his indignation here, worketh for our eternall good, is the right, knowledge that God will indue his people with; for the true knowledge of God and a pure minde goes together, being attained unto by the Croſſe, and by the true revelation of the Son of God, made manifeſt in the fleſh by his ſufferings, that as he overcame death, and now ſits at the right hand of the Father, ſo might we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo overcome, and be fellow-heirs with him.</p>
            <p>Away with the knowledge the world hath, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend God to be good to them in time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, ſorrow, miſery and calamity, in the time of their triall; but deem that they are out of Gods favour, and lie down either deſpairing of happineſſe, looking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out themſelves, and revile others, which they conceive have been the cauſe of that that is fallen upon them.

            <p>Truth and right government, according to the perfect Law of God, is moſt ſerviceable, in its place, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be performed, rightly, but by ſuch as fear God, and hate covetouſneſſe, that are impartiall.

            <p>Wherefore, let all the Teachers, that are at this day, who have took upon them, to teach; examine, and try themſelves, whether they are of the ſame Spirit, that their Lord Chriſt was of, when he taught upon the mount,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had foiled the Tempter, he pronounceth happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and bleſſedneſſe to divers; As to the poore, to the mourner, to the meek, to the hungry, to the mercifull, to the pure, to the peace-makers, and to them that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted: proove your ſelves, yee teachers of men, whether the ſame minde be in you, as was in Chriſt Jeſus; he was according to all theſe ſeverall ſorts of people, &amp; he giveth them comfort, whom comfort belongeth unto, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe to them that are pure, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>None ſhould be teachers of others, but thoſe that are Beleevers; for the ſimple and plain Beleever is the beſt ſpeaker: <hi>David</hi> ſaid, I did beleeve, therefore I ſpake;<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.10.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, had he not truly beleeved, he had not been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſpeaking; a true Beleever may be a right Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and a right Interpreter. But pity it is, that where the Teacher is defective, there is joyned the traditions of men with the pure Word, &amp; with Chriſts commands; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall paganiſh Philoſophy, with the anointing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the orders and degrees of Schools, rudiments of the world with the miniſtery of Chriſt which is from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

the way of the righteous is light, that ſhineth more and more to the perfect day, to build them up into the unity of faith, and to lead them from faith to faith, into the perfect knowledge of the Son of God, to be a perfect man, into the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When will the time come, that there ſhall be no more complaint againſt unſavoury ſalt, blinde guides, &amp; divine Merchants?

Moſt certain it is, that there is a generation of teachers that are not ſent by the Lord, who are deſperate enemies to the pure truth,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.21.

manner of way as much as any? It is a ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil for a diſeaſed man to ſay, Phyſician, heal thy ſelf: or for an Auditour to ſay to the preacher, Pull the beam out of thine own eye. That light which is ſprung up &amp; ſent among us from the Lord, let them obey it, though never ſo croſſe to their wils, leſt that, after all their learning, teaching, preaching, praying and exerciſing,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.1.</note> they be found among the raging Heathen; or, which is worſe, to be their Abettours and Ring-leaders. Think upon the complaints that the Lord often hath made againſt the Prophets, who cauſed his people to erre: Judge your ſelves, that you be not judged and condemned of the Lord; Try and examine your ſelves, ye that call your ſelves ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> for the Lord is coming to try and to refine you.</p>
            <p>Great is the goodneſſe of God to his Church, that he hath made ſuch a diſcovery, that they in whom we truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have been our introduction, we muſt forſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to a better, and a more lively hope to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellings of God, than to attend the ordinances of man; that ſpeaks nought but death: the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note> but they have deſtroyed the true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge; they have known the will of the Lord; but they have not done it; they have thruſt themſelves into Chriſts office, meerly to get profit, favour, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. It is a great miſchief, and a deadly injury to be blinde-led; Chriſt ſaith, If the blinde lead the blinde, they both fall into the ditch, that is, they fall into that they cannot eaſily get out, and when they are, through mercy, helped out, they muſt be cleanſed from the filth of the ditch which they have received, in the ditch. If by leading men fall, where their deſire is to avoid, what are they better by leading? what a heavie account have theſe leaders to give above all others?</p>

It is much that the Devil, the great red Dragon, ſhould make Heaven his place to war in; ſo it is, he is now warring againſt <hi>Michael</hi> in Heaven, that is, in religion, in and among the Profeſſors therof; but the comfort is, he ſhall not prevail, although his angels make ſport and recreation to fulfill the anger of God, being the very fire of God, and his bellowes alſo to blow up the fire; they do onely his will, in purging away the droſſe of his people, by their moſt fiery contentions, brawlings, revilings,<note place="margin">Zach. 8.10.

            <p>When Almighty God hath melted his people, and burnt up their droſſe, and utterly conſumed it, then ſhall they come to be in union with him, living and abiding with him for ever. This is that new Jeruſalem that <hi>John</hi> ſaw, that came down from God out of Heaven, wherein there is no temple nor ordinance, being there is no need. In the time of the Apoſtacie, after the Apoſtles dayes, which yet remains (although wounded) then there was a need of Paſtours and Teachers, as the onely means of diſtributing light to the world, like unto the light of the Moon, alwayes changing, ſomtimes Popery, ſomtimes Epiſcopacie, ſometimes Presbytery, Independent, and Baptized. So that God was alwayes well pleaſed, to make ſome cloudy diſcoveries of himſelf, by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of men. But the day of the Lord being now dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Chriſt who is our light ſhall appear again, and the power of Antichriſt, which waxed ſo great, ſhall be clean taken away, and the rent that was made, ſhall be made whole: God will cement his people to himſelf, and he will be their light and defence.<note place="margin">Pſal. 83. ult.</note> And this is Babylons plague, yea, the vexation of the grand Profeſſours that are now full, and will not obey the true light, but do perſecute it, calling it the new light, or new lights, being blinde to the diſcoveries that God hath made to his people of the Whore, and of her deſtruction, and of the pureſt fleſh, and the glory thereof, which muſt be burnt, that God may be all in all in his people, and never be any more forms.</p>

Happy art thou if thou findeſt within thy ſelf the God of love and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy, anyway to appear: if in that thou haſt received thou haſt ſeen a hand directing it to thee, though it be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, take it from the Lord, as a token of his infinite love; rejoyce in thy low condition, the Lords eye is over thee, and will nevertheleſſe judge thine oppreſſour, he hath a regard to the poor, he will defend them, he wil bring them them out of the duſt, and ſet them among Princes: all that wait upon the Lord, ſhall ſee his goodneſſe, in the Land of the Living. Let all therefore ſay, that have not to their deſire in outward appearance of Gods favour, Verily thou O God hideſt thy ſelf, O God thou Saviour of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, whatever thou art, that doſt draw neer to God in any outward performance, meditate with thy ſelf to what end thou doſt it, and be more neer to hear than to offer the ſacrifice of fools;<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4.17, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Conſider in your mindes: would a mortall man be ſo ſerved, that is in ſome regall authority, and do you think the great God can bear it? No, if this be your reſolved practice, he will caſt you into utter darkneſſe, that doth thus counterfeit and diſſemble with him, who ſeeth the heart; you ſhall never have the light of his countenance here, nor that Heaven which you care little for, hereafter. Behold, the day of the Lord is very neer at hand, and he cometh as a thief in the night:<note place="margin">Revel. 3.2.</note> Who may abide the day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
